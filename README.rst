JavaScript Experiments
======================

Some JavaScript experiments. You can see them online using the links below.
`Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome>`_ is the best browser
for these demos, but `Opera <http://www.opera.com>`_ or
Firefox should be fine too.

`Gray-Scott <http://pmneila.github.com/jsexp/grayscott/>`_
==========================================================

`Gray-Scott <http://pmneila.github.com/jsexp/grayscott/>`_
is a solver for the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model. Roughly, this
can be seen as a simulation of the behavior of diffusive living beings reproducing
under conditions of limited food. Very different patterns emerge for
slight changes in feeding and death rates.

This experiment uses `Three.js <http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/>`_
and performs calculations on the GPU.
It requires a WebGL enabled browser.
